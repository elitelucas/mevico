It is the base path where the files are.
We have an nginx service with ssl certificates
pointing to frontend and backend

/var/www

FrontEnd:
/var/www/MedicalVideoConsultancyBuild
Since nginx points to this path, it does not require any additional execution. If you are going to upload changes, the only thing you have to do is delete all the files and place the new ones.


BackEnd:
/var/www/MedicalVideoConsultancyServer
If you are going to put the new files you will need to stop the nodejs server.
You perform the command "ps -aux" to list the processes and look for the only one that corresponds to node. You kill the process by giving it the process id "kill -9 [process_id]". then you start the service with "node src/index.js"
if you want the service not to die, you just need to perform "node src/index.js &"

PeerServer
/var/www/peerServer
It is a server for video calls that there are still improvement issues that I am making apart. In case you require it (nemiac.com:9000) it is activated with the command "node index.js"
