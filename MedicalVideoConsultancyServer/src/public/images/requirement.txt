I propose the following:
Divide into two milestones comprising:
milestone 01: (1 week or 1 week and a half)
Understanding of the project (source code) and deployed on the server.
Complete web interfaces (angular) for patient and doctor profiles.
* Correction of observations

milestone 02: (1 week or 1 week and a half)

Integrate the functionalities with the backend between angular and nodejs.

* Correction of observations

Interface improvements based on the material-angular-lite template.
